# Timetable-Manager

This project is specially developed to help people manage their routines properly. This will let users make a timely routine of each day so they can follow it. This will be more useful for the students or the college-going youth.

This system uses Android Studio for its front end development and functioning. This app doesn’t need a backend as this type of applications use the data from the phone itself and projects that to the user. The data will be stored locally in the device using SQLite.

The users would need to register themselves using credentials and then log in to the app. Once done, they will be able to use it and enter their tasks and time table in a timely manner.
